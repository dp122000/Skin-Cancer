# Skin-Cancer

This project is for the development of a classification Model of Skin Lesions as a Diagnostic Tool for Skin Cancer​.

Skin cancer is one of the most common and dangerous cancers, and detecting it early is critical. It usually manifests as skin lesions.​

A Lesion​ an area of abnormal or damaged tissue caused by injury, infection or disease. It can occur on any tissue anywhere including the skin.​

**Classifications of Skin Lesions​**

**Cancerous Lesion (Malignant): ​**

Melanoma, ​

Basal Cell Carcinoma ​

Squamous Cell Carcinoma ​

**Non-Cancerous Lesion (Benign):​**

Melanocytic Nevus (Mole) ​

Seborrheic Keratosis ​

Dermatofibroma ​

Actinic Keratosis.​

**Problem Statement**

Diagnosing skin cancer from images is challenging due to the visual similarity between different skin lesions, even for experts. ​

**Objective**

To develop an AI based model that can help dermatologists by identifying the type of skin lesion  in an image. This could assist in early and accurate skin cancer diagnosis, potentially saving lives.​

**Stakeholders**

Dermatologists ​

Patients ​

Medical Institutions/Hospitals ​

AI/Health Tech Developers ​

Regulatory Bodies (e.g., Ministry of Health)​

**Data Source, data cleaning and visualization**

This dataset is not just about whether someone has skin cancer or not, it's about:

Classifying skin lesions into detailed diagnostic categories, including types of skin cancer, benign lesions and indeterminate conditions.

Here are the general categories of skin lesions however each category has different types:

- Malignant (Skin Cancer)
 e.g., Melanoma, Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)

- Benign (Non-Cancerous Lesions)
 e.g., Nevus (mole), Seborrheic keratosis, Dermatofibroma

**Data** : Images of the different skin lesions.​

**Source**:  Kaggle, The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)​

**Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/isic-2024-challenge/data​

**Size:** ~40,000 high-quality dermoscopic images​

**Labels**: Each image is labeled with an ID linking it to the metadata.​

**Data cleaning, analysis and visualzation**

**Insights and Recommendations**

**Insights​**

The model can be used as an initial screening tool for skin lesions thus contributing to improved diagnosis of skin cancer.​

The model is capable of fairly accurate real time image classification; however, diagnosis confirmation should be done by a medical practitioner.​

**Recommendations​**

Improve dataset diversity to include a wide range of skin tones and lesion types​

Validate model clinically before deployment​
Incorporate feedback mechanism from clinicians​
